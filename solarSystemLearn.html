                    This is the star of our solar system, located about 150 million kilometers <br>
                    from Earth. This ball of hot plasma is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium. A <br>
                    strong gravitational force pulls in planets, asteroids, comets, and debris, causing <br>
                    these things to orbit around it. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Sun is what lights up the Earth ever since it formed 4.6 billion years ago. <br>
                    Sunlight is what allows for both plant and animal life on our planet, and it's <br>
                    ultraviolet rays allow you to get a tan on sunny days.<br>
                    <br>
                    Its mass takes up 99.9% of our solar system, at 1.99e30 kg. It's 330,000 times the <br>
                    mass of Earth, but it's radius is only about 100 times the earth, at 696,342 km.<br>
                    Though it's the largest item in our solar system, it's actually an average size<br>
                    for a star. It gets extremely hot, as well; the hottest part of the Sun is it's<br>
                    core, at 15 million C, while it's surface is much, much cooler at 5504.85 C.<br>

                <p>
                    Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, as well as the smallest in our solar<br>
                    system. It's radius is only 2439.7 km, not much larger than the Earth's moon.<br>
                    It's also the fastest in our solar system; due to it's close distance to the <br>
                    Sun, it goes extremely fast at a speed of 47 kilometers per second. A year on<br>
                    Mercury, or the time it takes to fully orbit around the Sun, is only 88 days
                    on Earth.<br>
                    <br>
                    Mercury has no rings or moons, and it has a rough, rocky surface. Like the <br>
                    Earth's moon, it's surface is covered in craters. It's core is metallic and<br>
                    partially molten and takes up 85% of the planet's radius. Mercury doesn't have<br>
                    an atmosphere, but instead has an exosphere made of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, 
                    helium, and potassium. <br>
                    <br>
                    It also has extreme temperatures that dramatically change during its day and night. <br>
                    During the day, it can reach temperatures of 430 C and dip down to -180 C during the <br>
                    night. It's days are quite long, though; it takes 176 Earth days for Mercury to 
                    complete a full day-night cycle.<br>

                <p>
                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun, as well as the hottest. Though Mercury<br>
                    is closer to the Sun, Venus' atmosphere traps the heat in and causes it to heat<br>
                    up more. It's atmosphere is made out of carbon dioxide, with clouds made out of<br>
                    sulfiric acid. Because of this, it can get to 475 C on its surface.<br>
                    <br>
                    Compared to Earth, it's incredibly similar. In fact, some people call it Earth's <br>
                    sister planet. It's size is nearly the same as Earth; it's radius is only 300km<br>
                    smaller, at 6051 km. It's mass isn't too far off either, at 4.87e24 kg. <br>
                    <br>
                    Venus also has many natural structures on its surface. It's covered in valleys,<br>
                    mountains, and volcanoes. One day on Venus takes 243 Earth days, and one year<br>
                    takes 225 Earth days. It's also the brightest object in the night sky from 
                    Earth, after the moon.

                    Our Earth is unique in a lot of ways. Not only is it the only planet that<br>
                    we know of with life, it's surface is also covered in water. In fact, 71%<br>
                    of the Earth is water. It's the third planet from the Sun and about 150<br>
                    million kilometers away. Earth also has one moon, referred to as "The Moon".<br>
                    <br>
                    Earth is the fifth largest planet in the solar system and the largest of<br>
                    the terrestial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars). It has a radius of<br>
                    6371 km and a mass of 5.97e24 kg. It's temperatures are not extreme at all,<br>
                    ranging from -89.2 to 56.7 C. <br>
                    <br>
                    Earth's atmosphere is one of the things that allows life to flourish here.<br>
                    It's made out of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and the rest is made out of <br>
                    other gases such as argon or carbon dioxide. Much like the other terrestial<br>
                    planets, Earth also has a molten core, which can reach temperatures of 5,400 C.<br>

                <p>
                    Unlike the other planets in our solar system, the Earth only has one moon.<br>
                    It lights up the night sky as both the largest and brightest thing there,<br>
                    and it's also the only place where humans have stepped foot outside of our<br>
                    Earth - most famously, the Apollo 11 mission with Neil Armstrong, in 1969.<br>
                    <br>
                    Though we can see it pretty well from Earth, the moon is actually<br>
                    incredibly far away: 384,400 kilometers. Considering that it has a radius of<br>
                    just 1737.4 km, it's a wonder that we can see it as well as we can. Other<br>
                    than just being pretty, the moon also affects us a lot - the moon's gravitational<br>
                    pull on the Earth causes the tides. <br>
                    <br>
                    Occasionally, the moon, Earth, and Sun will align in a straight line. When this <br>
                    happens, it's called an eclipse. A solar eclipse is when the moon completely<br>
                    blocks out the Sun from Earth. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth blocks the 
                    Sun from the moon. <br>

                <p>
                    Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is also known as "the red planet".<br>
                    It has a radius of 3389.5 km, about half the size of Earth, and a mass of<br>
                    6.42e23 kg. Similar to the Earth, one day on Mars is 24.6 hours. A year,<br>
                    on the other hand, is 687 Earth days.<br>
                    <br>
                    Mars appears red because of the iron oxide (rust) dust on its surface. Though<br>
                    its actual surface is many different colors, the dust makes it appear entirely<br>
                    red from a surface. Mars also has two moons: Phobos and Deimos. Phobos, the larger<br>
                    of the two, is slowly getting closer to Mars. It will collide with the planet in
                    about 50 million years. <br>
                    <br>
                    Mars' core is made up of iron, nickel, and sulfur. It's surface is made of iron,<br>
                    magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. Much like the other terrestial planets,<br>
                    Mars is home to volcanoes and canyons. There is also evidence that Mars once had <br>
                    liquid water, but any water now is in the form of ice.<br>

                <p>
                    During the formation of our solar system, dust particles combined creating larger <br>
                    bodies, some of which became asteroids. Asteroids are minor planets, meaning that<br>
                    they are bodies orbiting around the sun that aren't planets or comets. There are <br>
                    currently 1,113,527 known asteroids, the majority of which are in the asteroid belt<br>
                    between Mars and Jupiter. They have a dramatic range of sizes, from 10m to 530km.<br>
                    <br>
                    Asteroids come in three different types: C-Type, S-Type, and M-Type. C-Type asteroids<br>
                    are the most common, and are made up of clay and silicate rocks. S-Type asteroids are<br>
                    made of silicate and nickel-iron. M-Type asteroids are metallic, and their composition<br>
                    varies. <br>
                    <br>
                    Asteroids are usually very irregularly shaped, with many craters and pits, as <br>
                    because they usually hit other debris in their orbits. There are also some asteroids<br>
                    large enough to have their own "moons" or two, about 150 different asteroids known<br>
                    so far. Some asteroids have even been known to orbit other asteroids.<br>

                    The fifth planet from the Sun, Jupiter, is the largest planet in our<br>
                    solar system by quite a large margin. With a mass of 1.90e27 kg and a <br>
                    radius of 69,911 km, it's more than twice as large as all the other planets<br>
                    in our solar system <i>combined</i>. It's about 778 million kilometers away from the Sun.<br>
                    <br>
                    Jupiter also has one the shortest days in the solar system, as one day on Jupiter<br>
                    is equal to just 10 Earth hours. Its years are very long though, with one year<br>
                    taking 4,333 Earth days, or about 12 times an Earth year. Jupiter has many, many moons:<br>
                    53 confirmed, and 26 more potential moons. Its largest and most well known moons are<br>
                    Io, Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. Jupiter also has its own rings, though they are <br>
                    much more faint than the rings of Saturn and made of dust.<br>
                    <br>
                    Jupiter's famous red spot is actually a giant storm that's even bigger than Earth.<br>
                    Jupiter doesn't have an actual surface, though; it's made of gases and liquids. <br>
                    The composition of the planet is mostly hydrogen and helium, but deep in the planet,<br>
                    the increase in temperature and pressure turn this hydrogen into a liquid. This means<br>
                    that Jupiter actually has a giant ocean of hydrogen, the largest ocean in the solarsystem.<br>

                    Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, has a very unique characteristic that<br>
                    it's famous for: large, intricate rings. It's also the second largest planet<br>
                    in the solar system (after Jupiter), with a mass of 5.68e26 kg and a radius of<br>
                    58,232 km. At the same time, it's the least dense planet. Similar to Jupiter, <br>
                    Saturn also has a short day, at 10.7 hours. Its year is 10,756 Earth days.<br>
                    <br>
                    Saturn has many moons, with 53 confirmed moons and 29 more potential moons. It's <br>
                    composed of mostly hydrogen and helium, and its surface is non-existent, as its <br>
                    entirely gases and liquids. Its rings are made of ice, dust, and rock broken into <br>
                    billions of small pieces. They extend 282,000 km out of the planet, but are very thin,<br>
                    with a height of only 10m.<br>
                    <br>
                    The rings of Saturn are thought to have been created from broken asteroids, comets, or<br>
                    moons. The particles that its rings are made of have a dramatic size range, with some as<br>
                    small as dust, some as large as houses, and some as large as mountains. Each ring has a<br>
                    different orbit speed around Saturn and are named by the letters "A" through "G".<br>

                <p>
                    Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and one of the two ice giants in our<br>
                    solar system. It's the third largest planet in our solar system, with a radius of<br>
                    25,362 km and a mass of 8.68e25 kg. What really makes it unique, though, is its <br>
                    axis; its equator is sideways, at an angle of 97.77 degrees. This causes extreme<br>
                    seasons on Uranus; winter is 21 years long.<br>
                    <br>
                    Uranus has 27 known moons, many of which appear to be made of water rock. Uranus<br>
                    also has two sets of rings, with a total of eleven individual rings. As an ice<br>
                    giant, Uranus is made out of many "icy" materials, like water, ammonia, and methane.<br>
                    Though its surface temperature is cool, at -195 C, its core is extremely hot at<br>
                    4,982 C. In it's atmosphere, Uranus can get to -224.2, even colder than Neptune. <br>
                    <br>
                    The surface of Uranus isn't a true surface - the planet is made out of mostly fluids,<br>
                    after all. It's atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane.<br>
                    It's methane that gives the planet its signature blue color. Methane absorbs the red portions<br>
                    of sunlight, leaving behind the blue and green portions that color the planet. <br>

                <p>
                    Neptune is the farthest planet from the sun in our solar system. In fact,<br>
                    it's the only planet not visible from the Earth to the naked eye. One year<br>
                    on Neptune takes 60,190 Earth days, or 165 Earth years. Neptune has a mass of<br>
                    1.02e26 kg and a radius of 24,622 km, making it four times larger than Earth.<br>
                    <br>
                    Neptune has 14 known moons, with its largest moon being Triton. Triton is unique<br>
                    in our solar system because it orbits Neptune in an opposite direction to Neptune's <br>
                    rotation (known as a retrograde orbit). Neptune also has five main rings, as well as <br>
                    four clumps of dust known as arcs. The arcs are interesting because the laws of motion<br>
                    predict they would spread out, but instead they remain together. <br>
                    <br>
                    Neptune is also the densest of the gas giants. Similar to Uranus, Neptune is made out of<br>
                    "icy" materials, like water, methane, and ammonia. It also has a small rocky core. Though<br>
                    it's atmosphere is made up of methane, hydrogen, and helium just like Uranus, Neptune has <br>
                    a much brighter blue color due to an unknown component. <br>

                <p>
                    Pluto is considered a dwarf planet now, but when it was first discovered in 1930,<br>
                    it was considered a planet. It's extremely small, with a radius of 1151 km, and it's <br>
                    only about half the width of the United States. Pluto is 5.8 billion kilometers away <br>
                    from the Sun, and it's orbited by 5 moons. Pluto's largest moon, Charon, is half the <br>
                    size of Pluto itself. <br>
                    <br>
                    Pluto's atmosphere is very thin, and it expands as it gets closer to the sun during its <br>
                    orbit. Pluto's orbit is very strange; rather than being circular, it is elliptical as well <br>
                    as tilted. When it's closest to the Sun, Pluto is actually closer to the Sun than Neptune. <br>
                    <br>
                    One day on Pluto is 153 hours, while one year on Pluto is 248 Earth years. Pluto's reclassification<br>
                    happened after other very similar objects were found in our solar system. The definition of a planet,<br>
                    which was previously very vague, went under review. Pluto was found to not fit all of the new <br>
                    requirements for the definition of a planet and so became a dwarf planet.<br>

                <p>
                    Comets are pieces of ice coated in dark organic material. They may have <br>
                    brought water and organic material to planets like Earth, two things that are<br> 
                    the building blocks of life. They are most likely left over from the beginning <br>
                    of our solar system 4.6 billion years ago.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are two kinds of comets that visit our solar system. Long period comets, many which<br>
                    come from a region called the Oort Cloud extremely far away, can take as long as 30 million<br>
                    years to travel around the Sun. This makes these comets extremely unpredictable. Short period<br>
                    comets, on the other hand, usually come from a region near Pluto and take less than 200 years <br>
                    to orbit the Sun. This makes them easier to predict, as they've usually passed around the Earth<br>
                    a few times already.<br>
                    <br>
                    A comet has a nucleus made of ice, frozen gases, and dust. As a comet gets closer to the Sun,<br>
                    these ices become gases and the comet's atmosphere grows, giving it a glow. Solar winds can <br>
                    blow this atmosphere away from the Sun, creating a comet's long signature tail. <br>
