               <img src="big bang.jpg">
               <p>
                    The Big Bang Theory is the most widely accepted theory about how the universe came to<br>
                    be. Obviously, we can't go back in time and see exactly what happened, but astronomers<br>
                    have seen evidence of the Big Bang's "echoes" and have developed formulas and models <br>
                    in order to find out more about the creation of the universe. <br>
                    <br>
                    The theory claims that the universe was originally condensed into a single point, that<br>
                    was infinitely dense and hot. Suddenly, though, this point exploded and expanded faster<br>
                    than the speed of light, and eventually came to an end. The universe heated until it<br>
                    could produce particles, which eventually formed neutrons, electrons, and protons. These<br> 
                    are the building blocks of the world as we know it. This all happened within a second, heating<br>
                    the universe to incredible amounts, but visible light still didn't exist in the universe. <br>
                    It would take hundreds of thousands of years for the universe to cool enough for neutral<br>
                    atoms to be formed. Then, photons were able to attach to these atoms and create visible light.<br>
                    <br>
                    This is naturally a severe oversimplification of the Big Bang Theory, as the actual theory <br>
                    is extremely complicated and scientific. However, there are still many unanswered questions <br>
                    about the Big Bang, which scientists have been working to answer to this day. <br>

                <p>
                    Galaxies aren't scattered across the universe at random. Rather, they clump together <br>
                    in groups, which in turn clump together in structures called superclusters. The supercluster<br> 
                    that our galaxy is in is called the Laniakea Supercluster. Our supercluster is a group of <br>
                    about 100,000 different galaxies, and it stretches out for 520 million light years.<br>
                    <br>
                    Some of the groups of galaxies in the Laniakea supercluster are the Hydra-Centaurus <br>
                    supercluster, the Virgo supercluster (where the Milky Way is), the Southern supercluster,<br> 
                    and the Pavo-Indus supercluster. These groups were initially thought to be their own<br>
                    supercluster, as seen in their names, but were found to be just a part of a larger <br>
                    supercluster, the Laniakea, in a 2014 study.<br>
                    <br>
                    Despite what it may seem, though, these supercluster structures are not actually <br>
                    gravitationally bound to each other. In fact, over the next few billions of years,<br>
                    the Laniakea supercluster will eventually drift apart. Any groups already bound to <br>
                    each other will stay together, but those that haven't already bound never will.<br>
                    Those galaxies will simply drift away into the endless ocean of our universe.<br>

                <img src="dark matter.jpg">
                <p>
                    Dark matter cannot be seen, and technically we don't know if it actually exists. However,<br>
                    we assume that it does because without it, the universe simply wouldn't make any sense. After all,<br>
                    dark matter theoretically makes up 80% of the universe. It doesn't emit light or energy, and thus,<br>
                    it is completely invisible to any sensors. <br>
                    <br>
                    However, we know that <i>something</i> is out there despite all that. The movement of the stars <br>
                    show that there is more mass out there than can be seen, and if there was no hidden mass out there,<br>
                    clusters of galaxies should have flown apart based on their visible mass. Because of this, most <br>
                    agree that dark matter does truly exist.<br>
                    <br>
                    As far as we know, dark matter is spread across the universe in a net-like fashion. Galaxy clusters <br>
                    form where the fibers of the "net" intersect. Scientists have been working in order to understand<br>
                    any more about this mysterious invisible matter, and efforts to decipher what it truly is are still 
                    underway.<br>
