               <p>
                    Stars are balls of plasma held together by gravity. One star that you might be <br>
                    familiar with is our Sun, which is the only star in our solar system as well as the<br> 
                    closest one to us. Stars develop from clouds of hydrogen and helium, as the clouds<br>
                    collapse inward due to gravity. The clouds become hotter and denser, and atomic nuclei<br>
                    begin to fuse together. This ignites the star and begins its life.<br>
                    <br>
                    Stars have a very specific life cycle, decided by their initial mass. Stars with a <br>
                    larger mass often have a shorter life span, while stars with too small a mass fail <br>
                    to become a star altogether. When stars are born, they start to use up their hydrogen<br>
                    as fuel. As they use up their fuel, stars enter the next stage of their life cycle, going<br>
                    from red giant to white dwarf to black dwarf. At that point, the star is too faint to detect.<br>
                    <br>
                    Our Sun is still in the beginning stage of its life cycle where it still has fuel to burn.<br>
                    In about 5 billion years, our Sun will begin its transformation and go through the different <br>
                    stages. Stars like our Sun are actually what we see in the night sky, and there are <br>
                    hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way alone.<br>

                <p>
                    There are more planets than stars in our galaxy, and nearly all of them are outside of<br>
                    our solar system. Many of these planets are probably small, similar to size in Earth,<br>
                    and some could even be habitable. Over 4000 exoplanets have been discovered in the past <br>
                    few decades, but there are likely trillions out there. <br>
                    <br>
                    Much like in our solar system, exoplanets have a large variety of types, shapes, and <br>
                    orbits. Many of these exoplanets were discovered by the Kepler space telescope, like <br>
                    Kepler-51 D pictured above. These exoplanets surprised many scientists in the 1980s,<br>
                    as many of them are very different from the planets in our solar system. For example,<br>
                    51 Pegasi B, discovered in 1995, a planet with the mass of Jupiter that was 20 times <br>
                    closer to its sun than the Earth is to ours.<br>
                    <br>
                    Ever since the discovery of exoplanets, many space agencies have been looking for a planet <br>
                    just like Earth. Specifically, one in the "habitable zone" of its sun, which is the distance<br>
                    from a sun where the temperature allows for liquid oceans. This was critical for life on Earth,<br>
                    and naturally, us humans want to see if there's any other life out there.<br>

                <img src="white dwarf.jpg">
                <p>
                    White dwarfs are one of the parts of the life cycle of a star. As stars burn their<br>
                    hydrogen fuel, it's inevitable that they eventually run out. When that happens, the <br>
                    "corpse" of the star becomes a white dwarf. Not all stars do this; only stars with low<br>
                    or medium masses, like our sun, become white dwarfs. In fact, it's only 3% of stars that<br>
                    won't become a white dwarf in the future. <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite being much smaller than a normal star, white dwarfs can reach temperatures of<br>
                    more than 99,704 C. Because of their small size, though, they aren't very bright. They have<br> 
                    the mass of a sun, but they have a radius similar to the Earth. This makes them some of the <br>
                    densest objects in space, and they have gravity 300,000 times the gravity on Earth. <br>
                    <br>
                    A majority of white dwarfs eventually fade away, when all of their energy radiates into <br>
                    space and they are no longer able to be detected. At that point, they're referred to<br>
                    as "black dwarfs". Some white dwarfs, though, pull in extra mass and become neutron stars<br> 
                    or even a supernova or nova explosion.<br>

                <p>
                    Stars with large masses will sometimes explode in a supernova. When this happens,<br>
                    the outer layers can blow off and leave behind the core of the star. This core <br>
                    continues to collapse, as gravity pushes together protons and electrons to make <br>
                    neutrons. This is why neutron stars got their name. Neutron stars are extremely dense,<br>
                    with radiuses of just 10 kilometers and masses around 2.78e30 kg. <br>
                    <br>
                    Neutron stars also have extremely high gravity - 2 BILLION times the gravity of the<br>
                    Earth. They also spin extremely fast from the power of the supernova, about 716 times a second,<br>
                    slowing down over time. Neutron stars can also orbit each other, just like regular stars. When<br>
                    this happens and they are close enough, they can spiral closer until they crash. This creates <br>
                    an intense explosion called a "kilonova". <br>
                    <br>
                    One of these kilonovas occured in 2017, where researchers discovered that these explosions <br>
                    produced gold, platinum, and other elements. However, no one really knows what happened to <br>
                    the neutron stars afterwards - whether it created something known, like a black hole or a <br>
                    new neutron star, or something brand new.<br>

                <p>
                    Black holes have extremely strong gravitational attraction. In fact, it's<br>
                    so strong that light can't even escape it. They have three parts, or layers:<br>
                    the singularity, the outer event horizon, and the inner event horizon. The <br>
                    event horizon is the point of no return, where once a particle crosses, it <br>
                    can never leave. The gravitational force is constant across the event horizon.<br>
                    <br>
                    The singularity is in the inner region of the black hole, where the mass of the <br>
                    black hole is the most concentrated. Black holes are incredibly dense as well as <br>
                    incredibly destructive. A black hole can even tear apart a star if the star drifts<br>
                    into it. One common misconception about black holes is that they suck in and destroy<br>
                    everything. However, black holes actually don't suck things in like a vacuum. Objects<br>
                    are simply pulled toward it just like any other object with gravitational force.<br>
                    <br>
                    Black holes can't be seen like other objects in space, like stars or planets. They<br>
                    are detected by the radiation they release as objects are pulled in. Recently, though,<br>
                    an image of a black hole was taken after an incredible amount of work, research, and <br>
                    data. There's no doubt that this will greatly increase our understanding of black holes.<br>

                <p>
                    Red dwarfs are the most common kind of star in our galaxy, but they don't produce enough <br>
                    light to be seen by the naked eye from Earth.Because they don't produce much light, though,<br>
                    they don't use up as much energy as other stars and therefore have a longer lifespan. They<br>
                    form just like any other star, when a cloud of dust and gas is drawn together by gravity and <br>
                    fuses. However, red dwarfs are the smallest of the stars and reach a much lower temperature<br>
                    of 3,500 C. The lifespan of a red dwarf can be trillions of years.<br>
                    <br>
                    Though they live much longer, they don't live forever. Just like a normal star, red dwarfs <br>
                    eventually run out of fuel and collapse into a white dwarf. Red dwarfs have also been found<br>
                    to have planets orbiting around them, though gas giants like Jupiter are rare. <br>
                    <br>
                    Red dwarfs only weigh between 7.5% to 50% as much as our Sun, with masses from 1.6e29 to 9.9e29 kg.<br>
                    They are also different from normal stars because they burn all of their hydrogen, not just the <br>
                    hydrogen in their cores. Despite their low light and temperature, potentially habitable <br>
                    exoplanets have been found orbiting around red planets, such as a planet found in 2016 orbiting<br> 
                    Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun.<br>
